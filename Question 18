    console.log(typeof typeof 1)

The code console.log(typeof typeof 1) will output the string "string".

The typeof operator returns a string indicating the type of the operand's value. In this case, the operand of the first typeof operator is the value 1, which is a number. The second typeof operator then returns the type of the first typeof operator, which is a string.

Therefore, the output of the code will be the string "string".

Here is a breakdown of what happens when the code is executed:

The typeof operator is used to determine the type of the value 1. The value 1 is a number, so the typeof operator returns the string "number".
The value of the first typeof operator is assigned to a variable called x.
The typeof operator is used to determine the type of the variable x, which is a string. The typeof operator returns the string "string".
The value of the second typeof operator is printed to the console.
The output of the code is the string "string".
