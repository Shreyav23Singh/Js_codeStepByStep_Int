QUESTION 1
let a=[];
let b=[];
console.warn(a==b)
console.warn(a===b)
output
false
false

In JavaScript, the `==` operator checks for equality by performing type coercion, while the `===` operator checks for equality without type
coercion. 

This will output `false` because when using the `==` operator with arrays, it compares the object references, not the contents of the arrays.
Since `a` and `b` are two distinct array objects, their references are not the same, resulting in `false`.

This will also output `false` because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, including both value and type. Again, `a` and `b` are
two different array objects, so their types are different, resulting in `false`.

In conclusion, both `console.warn(a == b)` and `console.warn(a === b)` will output `false`.
