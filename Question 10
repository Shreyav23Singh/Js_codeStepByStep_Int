console.log(typeof [])

Output:-
Object

The code `console.log(typeof []);` will output the string `'object'`. 

In JavaScript, arrays are considered objects. The `typeof` operator is used to determine the type of a value or expression.
When `typeof` is applied to an array `[]`, it returns `'object'` because arrays are a type of object in JavaScript.
