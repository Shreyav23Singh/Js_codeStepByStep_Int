const obj ={
a:two ,
b:two,
}
console.log(obj)

This is because the const keyword makes the variable obj immutable, but the object it references can still be modified. In this case,
the object obj has two properties, both of which have the name a. The first property is assigned the value 'one', and the second property 
is assigned the value 'two'. When the code is executed, the second property will overwrite the first property, and the output will be the 
object with the single property a with the value 'two'.

Here is an explanation of what happens when the code is executed:

The const keyword is used to declare the variable obj. This means that the variable obj cannot be reassigned to a new value.
The object obj is created and assigned the value {'a': 'one', 'a': 'two'}.
The console.log() function is used to print the value of the variable obj.
The value of the variable obj is printed to the console. Since the object obj has two properties with the name a, the second property 
overwrites the first property, and the output is the object with the single property a with the value 'two'.
