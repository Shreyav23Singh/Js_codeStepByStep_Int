var num=8;
var num=10;
console.log(num)


In JavaScript, the `var` keyword is used to declare variables. However, it is important to note that variables declared with `var` can be 
re-declared without any errors. In your code, you have declared the variable `num` twice using `var`. 


When a variable is re-declared using `var`, it does not create a new variable. Instead, it simply updates the value of the existing variable.


In your case, the second declaration `var num = 10;` updates the value of the `num` variable to `10`. As a result, when you log `num` to the 
console with `console.log(num)`, it will output `10`, the updated value of the variable. The first declaration of `num = 8;` becomes redundant and does not have any effect on the final output.
