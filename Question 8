b. reference error
c.undefined

Ans :- A

In the code snippet you provided, there is a typographical error. The variable name is misspelled as `greating` instead of `greeting`.
However, I'll assume you intended to declare an empty object and assign it to the variable `greeting`.


The code declares a variable `greeting` and assigns an empty object `{}` to it. Then, it logs the value of `greeting` to the console.

The output of `console.log(greeting)` will be an empty object `{}`. This indicates that the variable `greeting` has been assigned an 
empty object as its value.
