/ /  The unary plus operator (+) attempts to convert its operand to a number. In JavaScript, true is internally represented as 1, and false as 0. 
Therefore, when you use + with true, it will convert it to the number 1. 


/ /  The logical NOT operator (!) negates the truthiness of its operand. In JavaScript, a non-empty string like 'abc' is considered truthy.
So, when you use ! with the string 'abc', it negates its truthiness and returns false.
